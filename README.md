# Kevin Wessa

## TL;DR

The marketing site for founder, designer and developer Kevin Wessa. After years building [Brewww Studio](https://brewww.studio), Kevin's passion for web development was solidified. A 2017 Wordpress site was no longer cutting it, and after years of sitting it idly by, it was time for a handcoded React + Vite site to hone skillsets.

The site will begin as a basic marketing site, but will expand to include design, photography, and development portfolios. The ideal is that the site itself is the ultimate portfolio item, continually developed with the latest skillsets to land clients and development jobs. For those needing a creative solution to a complex problem, meet [Kevin Wessa](https://www.kevinwessa.com).
